# Classmate!

Classmate! is an iOS application developed at PennApps 2017. It is designed to streamline college classroom communication.

Instead of being invited manually to participate in a groupchat by another student, Classmate! allows individuals to search for their class directly and join directly, alleviating the need for a middle man.
